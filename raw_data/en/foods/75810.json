This kind of crab wreaked havoc in Belobog before the Eternal Freeze occurred, and then inexplicably almost became extinct.<br />The meat of it is soft, tender, and delicious. Could this be the reason for their extinction? You dare not think further.<br /><br />\"Even if Rock Crabs live in rocks, they are still seafood. Don't you see they have the word \"crab\" in their name?\"",
