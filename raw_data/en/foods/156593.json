But the Vidyadhara race could live for a thousand years, much longer than the Foxians. Yu searched for ways to release his lover from the grip of death. He fell for the trickery of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and asked his lover to take the longevity medicine of Abundance without telling her what it was. The Foxian girl turned into an abomination that no longer loved him before being slain by the Cloud Knights. To prevent Yu, who was overwhelmed by grief, from becoming mara-struck, the Alchemy Commission ordered him to take the Longevity Pill of Cruelty that deprived him of love and desire until his demise.<br />The legend has another version, in which Yu was not of the Vidyadhara race but a mere mortal, and the Foxian girl was a spy planted by the Disciples to infiltrate the Alchemy Commission. This version is not as popular, for it turns a romance story into a power struggle.<br /><br />\"Longevity is a curse when life is deprived of passion and desire.\"",

It is for this reason that the Interdimensional Trees tend to shake off their leaves rather late in the year. To help their leaves land, these trees, in the course of evolution, gave their leaves the ability to conduct fast short-distance warp-jumps towards the ground at frequencies that cannot be observed by naked eyes. Even so, not every leaf gets to land on the ground. Those lucky enough to make it watch others rise into the sky and burn as they are devoured by the atmosphere.<br /><br />\"Wow.\"",
