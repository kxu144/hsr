Petals inquiring for love bend their lips,<br /><br />Like the ticking chimes in an infinite time and space. We have no choice,<br /><br />But to slide into the shivering calamities of the universe as if sliding down a slope into dusk.<br /><br />And with that, the stars continue their enjoyment above as their elegant smiles fill the way forward.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Rocky Martinez</align>",
