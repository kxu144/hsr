There are four flowers \u2014 two white, two purple \u2014 and nobody (including Hook) looked at their own flower nor anybody else's flower.<br /><br />Next, she asked everyone to line up facing the same direction. Hook was in the front, followed by Julian, Luka, and then Big Sister/Big Brother stood in order. Everyone can only look at the people in front of them and cannot turn their heads. They cannot turn around to look behind them, or peek at the color of their own flower.<br /><br />To keep things fair, Hook blindfolded Big Sister/Big Brother \u2014 because she/he's so tall!<br /><br />However, while they can't see their own flowers, we can see them as we walk by: Hook and Luka have white flowers, while Julian and Big Sister/Big Brother have purple ones.<br /><br />Despite Hook's best and fairest intentions, only one person in this game will be able to guess what color the flower they have on their head is. Who is that person?<br /><br />1. Hook<br />2. Julian<br />3. Luka<br />4. Big Sister/Big Brother",
