So, for safety concerns, we still can't see each other for the time being.<br /><br />I've found a job that should be able to keep our family afloat.<br /><br />I've always been sturdier than others, ever since I was a child. Even when I become sick, I'm still strong. So, no need to worry about me.<br /><br />Take good care of yourself and our kid.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Kluzer</align>",
